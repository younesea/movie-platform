# movie-platform

> A platform where you can easily search for (popular) movies.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

## Description
This application was build with [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). The application also renders on the server (universal).

### Time spent
I've created this small application in between other projects (in a busy week). I've spent around 7/8 hours in total, and I would probably be done quicker if I created the application on one day.

### Todos
Todos that I would do if I had more time
- Dive deeper in shaka player, and I would make a Vue package and/or Nuxt plugin for it.
- In the project I used Vueperslider (Vue slider package). If I had more time I would create a more simple component myself with css scroll snapping.
- Prettier design (I used the default Tailwind config)
- Fix edge cases, better error handling
